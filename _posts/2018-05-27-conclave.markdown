At least anti-social in that you can't share and broadcast with a 10 000 of your closest friends and family members. No, Conclave is old-school social, just with new-school tech. It's where the stuff that appears in your feed has been curated just for you by people that actually know you (what is this craziness!?. It's where you share content you find, but you share it only with the three people you know that really need to see it.
